Quick Note On Makefiles
-----------------------

Given that you've seen makefiles before, I'm going to have a companion section
for each code block that allows you to create a makefile to perform this
pipeline. Feel free to copy-paste the commands or paste rules into your
makefile. You only need to do one of these.


Or in Make:

.. code-block:: make

    RAW_READS   := reads/Emel-lb1234_R1.fastq.gz reads/Emel-lb1234_R2.fastq.gz
    AXE_KEY     := Emel-lb1234.axe
